# IFT6390 Fundamentals of Machine Learning
## Kaggle Competition 1

1) There are two Jupyter notebooks, LogReg_Kaggle.ipynb implements the Logistic Regression from scratch, OtherMethods_Kaggle.ipynb assesses all other major algorithms mainly using SKLearn.
2) The notebooks when executed in sequential order should give expected results.
3) There are references to temporary direct links (transfer.sh) to retrieve the train.csv and test.csv. If those links stop working please use a copy from the Kaggle competition page.
4) Please reach out to me if something doesn't work as expected: saurabh.bodhe@umontreal.ca
